## 0. Recent changes completed (2026-06-18)

- **Zoho OAuth removed (2026-06-22):** the Zoho provider was removed end to end (server +
  client) and its patches (0001/0011/0040) dropped from the stack. **GitHub** and **Google**
  are the only OAuth providers now. Verified: remote crate `cargo check` + remote-web build
  pass with zero Zoho references. (Prod still runs the old Zoho-enabled image until a build
  from current code is deployed — see §2/§6.)
- **Repo flattened to one root:** removed the extra `docker/` wrapper directory; deployment
  artifacts now live at project root (`docker-compose.yml`, `build.sh`, `Caddyfile*`,
  `.env*`, `ingest/`, `init-db/`, `sql/`, `scripts/{invite,backup}.sh`).
- **Docs/path refresh completed:** deployment guide is now `DEPLOYMENT_README.md`; all docs
  were updated to use root-level paths.
- **Relay removed from deployment:** no `relay` service in compose, no relay env vars in
  `.env.example` / `.env.production.example`, and no relay ops instructions in docs.
- **Build + config validation completed:** `docker compose config` passes; `./build.sh`
  succeeds; production-style build also succeeds (`docker compose --env-file .env.production.example build remote`).

## 1. Goal & model

Self-hosted, team-wide **Vibe Kanban** for Rokomari's engineering team, built entirely on
free/open-source software (upstream is **Apache-2.0**).

- **Deployment: Docker Compose, remote-only** (NOT Kubernetes/Helm — that path was
  explicitly dropped). One central VM runs the backend; developers run a **local `npx`
  client**. Browser/code-server "frontend pod" mode was excluded (needs the sysbox runtime).
- **Central server:** `https://vk.rokomari.io`.
- Plus a custom **issue-ingestion API** and an **invite flow**.

Companion docs (project root): `REQUIREMENTS_AND_PLAN.md`, `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`,
`EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, `DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md`. Deployment docs:
`DEPLOYMENT_README.md`, `GO_LIVE.md`, `ingest/README.md`, `ingest/API.md`,
`rok-vibe-kanban-launcher/README.md`.

## 2. Production facts

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| SSH | `ssh -i ~/.ssh/dev ubuntu@103.228.38.106` (host `server02`, Ubuntu, Docker no-sudo, passwordless sudo) |
| Domain | `https://vk.rokomari.io` (Cloudflare in front of the VM) |
| Compose dir on VM | `/home/ubuntu/vibe-kanban/` (**not** a git repo there — just deployed files) |
| Stack | `postgres` + `remote` (:8081) + `electric` (:3000 internal) + `caddy` (:80/:443); optional `ingest` profile |
| Remote image | `ghcr.io/iamriajul/vibe-kanban-team-remote`, pinned `IMAGE_TAG=0.1.44-20260617110518` |
| Team org | **"Rokomari SE Team"** = `a6a82264-9129-4537-aae4-63b51181b243` |
| Team project | **"Amaly"** = `63051e48-a41b-4242-8c67-138b24e7114a`, default status "To do" |
| Users | `admin@rokomari.io` (`d0b4a3d3-…`, bootstrap + **service account**, team admin) · `sakib@rokomari.com` (`798c8da6-…`, team admin) |
| Auth | **GitHub/Google OAuth** + bootstrap **local auth** (`admin@rokomari.io`). `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=rokomari.com`. ⚠️ Zoho OAuth has been **removed from the codebase**; prod still runs the old Zoho-enabled image until a build from current code is deployed. |
| Secrets | All in VM `/home/ubuntu/vibe-kanban/.env` (DB pw, JWT, OAuth client id/secret, INGEST_API_KEY, local-auth pw). **Not** in git. |

**⚠️ The patched frontend is currently served via a STOPGAP override on prod:**
`docker-compose.override.yml` mounts `./remote-web-dist` (a locally-built `remote-web`
bundle) over the container's `/srv/static`. This is because the GHCR image
(`0.1.44-20260617110518`) does **not** contain patch 0041 (invite-complete
redirect). The clean end-state is to build a remote image **with** that patch and pin
it, then delete the override + `remote-web-dist`. See §6.

---

## 3. Features delivered (all live on prod)

### Issue-ingestion API (`ingest/`, `--profile ingest`)
- `POST https://vk.rokomari.io/ingest/issues`, header `X-API-Key: <INGEST_API_KEY>`.
- Body: `{title (req), description?, priority? (Urgent|High|Medium|Low), dedup_key?, assignee? (team-member email)}`.
- Creates issues in **Amaly**, default status "To do". `dedup_key` = idempotent. `assignee`
  resolved against team-org members (needs `INGEST_ORG_ID=a6a82264…`); unknown email → issue
  still created, `assignee.resolved:false`.
- Node sidecar (no deps) that logs in as the service account (local auth) and calls `/v1/issues`.
  Caddy routes `/ingest/*` → `ingest:8090`. Caller ref: `ingest/API.md`.

### Invite flow
- Create: `scripts/invite.sh <email> [member|admin]` (run on the VM; reads admin
  creds + `INGEST_ORG_ID` from `.env`). Prints `https://vk.rokomari.io/invitations/<token>/accept`.
- Accept: open link → InvitationPage → **Continue with GitHub/Google** → joins team org → "Go to your
  workspace" (→ `/`). Then visible on Amaly + assignable (UI + ingest API).
- **Loops email is NOT configured** → delivery is manual link sharing. To enable email: set
  `LOOPS_EMAIL_API_KEY` + `LOOPS_INVITE_TEMPLATE_ID` (the baked-in default template IDs are
  the upstream author's and won't work — author your own templates in the Loops dashboard and
  set their IDs; patch `0013-update-loops-template-ids.patch` wires the IDs into the code).

### Service-account protection (`sql/protect-service-account.sql`)
- A Postgres trigger blocks DELETE/role-downgrade of `admin@rokomari.io`'s membership in the
  team org (it powers ingest + invite). Self-healing insert. Applied on prod. **Do not remove
  `admin@rokomari.io` from the org** — it'll just error now, but it's the service identity.

### Client launcher (`rok-vibe-kanban-launcher/`) — NOT yet published to npm
- `@rokomari/vibe-kanban`: sets `VK_SHARED_API_BASE=https://vk.rokomari.io`, pins
  `vibe-kanban-team@0.1.44-20260617110518`, fixed local port **8154** (`BACKEND_PORT`),
  **Node ≥20** guard.
- `install.sh` (NodeSource Node 22 + global install + **systemd `--user`** service, boot+linger),
  `uninstall.sh`, `test-ingest.sh`.

## 4. Downstream patches added (in `patches/`)

Submodule `vibe-kanban/` pinned at tag `v0.1.44-20260424091429`. Patch stack applied at build
time via `scripts/apply-patches.sh`. Our additions:
- **0041** — `InvitationCompletePage.tsx` "Get started" now links to `/` (was hardcoded to
  `www.vibekanban.com/docs/getting-started`).

> Zoho OAuth (former patches 0001/0011/0040) has been removed from both the source tree and
> the patch stack — GitHub and Google are the only OAuth providers now.

---

## 5. Critical gotchas / lessons (will bite you)

- **OAuth callback path is `/v1/oauth/{provider}/callback`** (provider in the middle), NOT
  `/v1/oauth/callback/{provider}`. E.g. GitHub redirect URI = `https://vk.rokomari.io/v1/oauth/github/callback`.
- **API enums:** issue `priority` is **lowercase** (`high`); member `role` is **UPPERCASE**
  (`MEMBER`/`ADMIN`).
- **Docker `.env` is NOT shell-sourceable** — values contain spaces (`INGEST_STATUS_NAME=to do`).
  Parse individual keys (`grep '^KEY=' .env | cut -d= -f2-`), don't `source` it.
- **`docker compose exec -T` consumes stdin** — inside `ssh '... ' <<'EOSSH'` heredocs it eats
  the rest of the script. Always add `</dev/null` to such exec calls.
- **Caddy:** changing which file is mounted needs `docker compose up -d --force-recreate caddy`
  (restart doesn't re-bind mounts). Editing mounted-file *content* + `caddy reload` is zero-downtime.
- **Never `rm -rf` a live bind-mounted dir then recreate without `--force-recreate`** — the
  container keeps a stale (empty) mount → 404s. (Hit this once; fixed with force-recreate.)
- **Node ≥20 required** for the npx client (Node 18 → `CustomEvent is not defined`).
- **Versioning quirks:** npm `vibe-kanban-team` versions are timestamped (`0.1.44-<ts>`); there
  is **no bare `0.1.44`** on npm. The Docker **`latest`** tag = `0.1.27` (diverged from npm
  `latest`). The `x-server-version` header is the *remote crate* version (`0.1.27`, constant) —
  NOT the release. Use the asset-bundle hash to tell builds apart.
- **Two frontends:** `remote` serves `packages/remote-web` (built into `/srv/static`); the npx
  client is `packages/local-web` (uses the shared `OAuthDialog`).
- `docker compose` profile services (`ingest`) need `--profile <name>` on **every**
  command (`up`/`pull`), or they get ignored/stopped.

## 6. Open items / next steps

1. **Make the frontend fix durable:** build a remote image WITH patch 0041 (and the current
   Zoho-removed code) and pin it in prod `.env` (`IMAGE_TAG`), then delete
   `docker-compose.override.yml` + `remote-web-dist` on the VM. Build is wired: `./build.sh`
   (applies patches → `docker compose build remote`) — see §7. Currently the patched frontend
   runs only via the override stopgap.
2. **Commit / new private repo:** the repo is uncommitted. User intends to **recreate a private
   repo**. Helm/k8s + CI were removed (see §8). To start clean: `rm -rf .git && git init`
   (the existing `.git` is the upstream `iamriajul` history). Artifacts to keep are
   listed in §8.
3. **Loops** email for invitations (optional; manual links work today).
4. **Publish** `@rokomari/vibe-kanban` to an npm registry (public `@rokomari` or internal).
5. **Configure GitHub/Google OAuth** for prod and deploy a build from the current
   (Zoho-removed) code, then clear the old Zoho `.env` vars on the VM.
6. **End-to-end invite test:** `joy@rokomari.com` was invited (pending) — confirm a real OAuth
   accept lands them in the team org.

---

## 7. Build-from-source (docker + vibe-kanban together)

The repo is self-contained: build the images from patched source, then `up`.
```bash
cp .env.example .env            # defaults to local images: vibe-kanban-team-remote:local
# set secrets / PUBLIC_DOMAIN / OAuth in .env
./build.sh                      # submodule init -> apply patches -> docker compose build remote
docker compose up -d
```
- `docker-compose.yml` has `build:` sections (`context: ${VK_DIR:-./vibe-kanban}`,
  `crates/remote/Dockerfile`). Building from source bakes the patched **frontend** in → no override needed.
- Rust release build is slow (~20–40 min). It **has** been run successfully to completion
  on this flattened layout (`./build.sh` success; production-style `docker compose build remote`
  also validated).
- To use a prebuilt image instead, set `REMOTE_IMAGE`/`IMAGE_TAG` in `.env` and skip `build.sh`.

(all CI), `prompts/`, and Helm-distribution docs (`README/ARCHITECTURE/RELEASE/CLAUDE/AGENTS`
in the old upstream tree).
